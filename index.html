        <p> Hi, I'm Alaa Odeh, a Palestinian girl, 20 years old, and I study 
        computer science apprenticeship 'AI focus' At An-Najah National 
        University. </p>
    <p> I am passionate about programs and creating websites, so I 
        registered with the Knowledge Academy to gain greater knowledge 
        and experience that would enable me to get a job after completing 
        the course. I am excited to explore how I can contribute to 
        creating a project that increases my experience in this field. </p>
